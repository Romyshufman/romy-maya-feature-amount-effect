# 0004_Ido_Set-size_effects
This experiment is aimed at studying the effect of WM load manipulation over outcome-irrelevant RL.

You will find here a JavaScript implementation of the paradigm containing a dual task of 2-armed bandit and a change detection task.

You will also find here a simple simulation and a replication of a conceptually similar paradigm.

Under experiment_01_21 folder you will find the JavaScript implementation of the paradigm for an online experiment using jspsych.

The 01/21 experiment is described here: https://osf.io/kchq4

Under replication_06_21 folder you will find the JS implementation of the new paradigm for the second experiment in this project.

The 06/21 experiment is described here: https://osf.io/6cz29

The WM_RL_2017 contains a replication of a basic TD(0) model.

The replication (pdf in folder) is based on: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28651789/
